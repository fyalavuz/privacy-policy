## Data We Collect

- The parsing and rendering happen locally in your browser.
- No data is sent to our servers because we do not operate any servers for this extension.

- **host permissions (http/https)**: Allows fetching the specific URL you provide for preview.
- **scripting**: Checks for key OG tags in the active tab to update the toolbar icon status.
- **sidePanel**: Displays the UI inside Chrome’s side panel.
