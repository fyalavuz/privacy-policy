# Privacy Policy for Test Your TV

**Last Updated:** January 3, 2026

## 1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how "Test Your TV" ("we", "our", or "us") handles your information when you use our tvOS application.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. The guiding principle of our application is simple: **We do not collect, store, or share your personal data.**

## 2. Data Collection
We do not collect any personal information, usage data, or analytics.

- **No User Accounts:** You do not need to create an account to use the app.
- **No Tracking:** We do not use third-party analytics SDKs (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase) or advertising networks.
- **No Uploads:** All diagnostic tests (display patterns, audio signals) are generated and processed locally on your Apple TV.

## 3. System Permissions & Usage
To function correctly, the app may request access to certain system features. This data is used solely for real-time display within the app and is never transmitted.

- **Local Network:** Used only to determine your connection status (e.g., Connected/Disconnected) and interface type (Wi-Fi/Ethernet) in the "System Info" dashboard. We do not scan your network or access other devices.
- **Game Controller Input:** We access input data from connected game controllers or the Siri Remote strictly to visualize button presses in the "Input Test" tool. This input data is transient and is not saved.
- **Audio:** We generate audio signals for the "Audio Lab" tests. We do not record audio from your environment.

## 4. Third-Party Services
Since we do not collect data, we do not share data with any third parties.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page or within the application.
