# Netpital Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-12-25

Netpital ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy
explains how the Netpital mobile app (the "App") handles information.

## Summary
- No account required.
- We do not run our own backend.
- Test results and settings are stored locally on your device.

## Information We Collect
The App does not collect personal information such as your name, email address,
or phone number.

The App stores the following data locally on your device:
- Test results (health score, download/upload speed, latency, bufferbloat,
  jitter, packet loss, timestamps).
- App settings and preferences.

## Network Requests
To measure performance, the App makes network requests to third-party endpoints.
These requests may expose your IP address to those providers as part of normal
internet communication. We do not receive or store this information.

## How We Use Information
Local data is used only to:
- Display your health reports and trends.
- Remember your settings.
- Improve your experience inside the App.

## Sharing of Information
We do not sell, trade, or share your personal information because we do not
collect it. We do not run a server that stores your test results.

## Third-Party Services
The App may contact third-party services to perform network tests. Those
services process network traffic according to their own privacy policies.

## Your Choices
- You can clear your local test history from within the App settings.
- You can uninstall the App to remove all locally stored data.

## Security
We use standard platform protections for local storage. However, no method of
storage is 100% secure.

## Children's Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect
personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted
in the App or at the policy URL you provide for app store listings.
